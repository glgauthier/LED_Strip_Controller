#LED Strip Controller

A project for controlling cheap 5050 LED strips better than their factory 
made controllers. 

#Version 1 (Completed):
-Support for the features found in the factory controller as well as
audio response

-Uses button input rather than IR remote

-Based on ATMEGA328P with Arduino bootloader

#Version 2 (In the works):
-Same features as previous version as well as an added IR receiver so
that it can work with any remote

-Much cleaner code, schematic, and board design

-Based on ATTINY85; cheaper and just as useful!
